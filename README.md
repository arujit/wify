# wify
### A simple Python tool for making your interaction with wifi easy.

### Features
    - find current wifi password for a saved network
    - find all available networks
    - change password from CLI

### Requirements
    - Python3
    - pip

### Motivation
I guess at least for MAC environment there is no easy way to find the current networks password
and change it if necessary. So this will be a tool for you if you don't want to leave your CLI in
case someone changed your password.

### Future RodeMap
    - Making this generic for windows and Linux environment
    - Available for ethernet also
    - speedtest from here

#### If you ever felt the pain by the constantly change of wifi password of your org then please contribute to the project.

#### Speed Test
speed test will be able to tell both your current upstream and downstream internet speed.
